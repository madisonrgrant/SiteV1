# personal-portfolio

Here's to the first version of my personal site!
Wanted to learn more about React, so I built it with React. 🤷🏼‍ 

Shout out to [Sara](https://salomonelli.github.io/personal-portfolio/) for the inspo and for the idea to use [Material UI](https://github.com/callemall/material-ui).




## Publish on GitHub Pages

1. Run `npm run deploy`. This will start the build process and push afterwards to the gh-pages branch.
2. Set under Settings > GitHub Pages the source to `gh-pages branch` and click `Save`.
